The notify utility continiously prints changes in a specified directory in the following format:

M changed/path/1
M changed/path/2
-


Where M stands for "Modifed", and "-" is the indicator of end of changeset

Utility only returns specific directories that have changed, it does not print
the files/directories that have been modified: you need to determine them
yourself
